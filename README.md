I am continuously developing myself in various fields of technology, including artificial intelligence, web design, and embedded systems. My current focus is on AI-powered projects related to image recognition and classification. At the same time, Iâ€™m enhancing my skills in front-end development by building user interface and user experience-driven applications.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been exploring microcontrollers, which has helped me gain hands-on experience in hardware-software integration. I enjoy discovering new technologies, and I am passionate about continuous learning and problem solving. With a strong sense of collaboration and effective communication, I approach every project as an opportunity for both personal and professional growth.
